# General
This extension switches the font on facebook profile pages to a kid font.
Got the idea from http://maketrumptweetseightagain.com/.

# How to add it?
Only works on Chrome. Select developer mode under extension, and load the folder.

# How to use it?
When on a profile page on facebook, click the extension icon, and click the "Kidify" button.
This will switch every post font.
